## FAST-Calib: LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration in One Second

FAST-Calib is an efficient target-based extrinsic calibration tool for LiDAR-camera systems (eg., [FAST-LIVO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2)). 

**Key highlights include:** 

1. Support solid-state and mechanical LiDAR.
2. No need for any initial extrinsic parameters.
3. Achieve highly accurate calibration results **in just one seconds**.

In short, it makes extrinsic calibration as simple as intrinsic calibration.

## 1. Prerequisites
PCL>=1.8, OpenCV>=4.0.

## 2. Run our examples
1. Prepare the static acquisition data in the `calib_data` folder (see [Single-scene Calibration Sample Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W87Dx3MUuPhTpCLvaavWqNUJZV03yU6L?usp=drive_link) from Mid360, Avia and Ouster, and [Multi-scene Calibration Sample Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g__plgFqp5tsk-TY7Ioh4RXru62AdLmr?usp=drive_link) from Avia):
- rosbag containing point cloud messages
- corresponding image

2. Run the single-scene calibration process:
```bash
roslaunch fast_calib calib.launch
```

3. After completing Step 2 for at least three different scenes, you can perform multi-scene joint calibration:
```bash
roslaunch fast_calib multi_calib.launch
```

## 3. Run on your own sensor suite
1. Customize the calibration target in the image below, with the CAD model available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hdC8xGCHNP47a-wSLPyjr_tpOeynNFEG/view?usp=sharing).
2. Collect data from three scenes, with placement illustrated below, and record them into the corresponding rosbags.
3. Provide the instrinsic matrix in `qr_params.yaml`.
4. Set distance filter in `qr_params.yaml` for board point cloud (extra points are acceptable).
5. Calibrate now!

💡 **Note:** You can run `scripts/distance_filter_tool.py` to quickly obtain suitable filter parameters.

## 4. Appendix
The calibration target design is based on the [velo2cam_calibration](https://github.com/beltransen/velo2cam_calibration).
